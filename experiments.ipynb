       "'Diagnosis\\nF43.24 Adjustment Disorder , With disturbance of conduct\\nOliver ’s emotional and behavioral responses,including irritability , frustration, and outbursts, appear to be maladaptive reactions to  \\nstressors, resulting in significant impairment in social and academic functioning. His conduct disturbances (e.g., emotional outbursts,  \\ndifficulty following expectations, and oppositional behaviors) are not better explained by another mental disorder and have emerged in  \\nthe context of adjustment to new environmental demands. Further assessment is needed to determine if the symptoms persist beyond  \\nthe expected period of adjustment or if another primary diagnosis is more appropriate.\\nCurrent Mental Status\\nOrientation :X3: Oriented to Person, Place, and\\nTime\\nGeneral Appearance :Appropriate\\nDress :Appropriate\\nMotor Activity :Unremarkable\\nInterview Behavior :Appropriate\\nSpeech :Normal\\nMood :Irritable\\nAffect:AppropriateInsight :Good\\nJudgment/Impulse Control :Good\\nMemory :Intact\\nAttention/Concentration :Good\\nThought Process :Unremarkable\\nThought Content :Appropriate\\nPerception :Unremarkable\\nFunctional Status :Mildly Impaired\\nRisk Assessment\\nPatient denies all areas of risk.

He discussed ongoi ng difficulties at school, including feeling isolated and bullied by peers, and expressed that he does not feel\\ncomfortable sharing these experiences with his parents, fearing their reaction would be to tell him to \"suck it up\" rather than provide\\nsuppor t. Oliver described his parents as generally unaware of the extent of his negative experiences at school. He also shared details\\nabout  family dynamics, including discipline practices at home, such as consequences for breaking rules, and his strategies for avoiding\\ndetection when breaking hous ehold rules. Oliver expressed a preference for staying with his mother, as she is less likely to discipline him.\\nHe also discussed his academ ic experience, noting that he finds his current math class unchallenging and is interested in advancing to a\\nhigher level. Oliver mentioned spendi ng summers in Hungary.\\nObjective Content\\nOliver was engaged and c ommunicative throughout the session, providing detailed responses to questions about his family, school, and\\nsocial experiences.

Oliver will demonstrate a 50% decrease in distress during transitions at home or school, with a reduction in frequency or intensity of\\nemotional outbursts\\nProgress: Progressing\\nAssessment / Additional Notes\\nOliver continues  to experience social difficulties at school, including bullying and isolation, which contribute to his reluctance to\\ncommunicate openl y with his parents. He demonstrates adaptive coping strategies but also engages in rule-breaking behaviors at home.\\nOliver is academ ically advanced and expresses boredom with his current coursework, indicating a need for greater academic challenge.\\nInterventions used during the session included Exploration of Coping Patterns, Exploration of Emotions, Supportive Reflection, and\\nPsycho-Education. Oliver was receptive to these interventions.\\nPlan\\nContinue to provide a suppor tive environment for Oliver to discuss his experiences and feelings. Explore strategies for improving\\ncommunication with his parents and managing peer relationships at school. Discuss options for academic advancement and advocate for\\nappropriate placement to address boredom and maximize engagement. Plan to coordinate with Oliver and his family regarding the next\\nsession time and date.
