       "'Diagnosis\\nF43.24 Adjustment Disorder , With disturbance of conduct\\nOliver ’s emotional and behavioral responses,including irritability , frustration, and outbursts, appear to be maladaptive reactions to  \\nstressors, resulting in significant impairment in social and academic functioning. His conduct disturbances (e.g., emotional outbursts,  \\ndifficulty following expectations, and oppositional behaviors) are not better explained by another mental disorder and have emerged in  \\nthe context of adjustment to new environmental demands. Further assessment is needed to determine if the symptoms persist beyond  \\nthe expected period of adjustment or if another primary diagnosis is more appropriate.\\nCurrent Mental Status\\nOrientation :X3: Oriented to Person, Place, and\\nTime\\nGeneral Appearance :Appropriate\\nDress :Appropriate\\nMotor Activity :Unremarkable\\nInterview Behavior :Appropriate\\nSpeech :Normal\\nMood :Irritable\\nAffect:AppropriateInsight :Good\\nJudgment/Impulse Control :Good\\nMemory :Intact\\nAttention/Concentration :Good\\nThought Process :Unremarkable\\nThought Content :Appropriate\\nPerception :Unremarkable\\nFunctional Status :Mildly Impaired\\nRisk Assessment\\nPatient denies all areas of risk.

He discussed ongoi ng difficulties at school, including feeling isolated and bullied by peers, and expressed that he does not feel\\ncomfortable sharing these experiences with his parents, fearing their reaction would be to tell him to \"suck it up\" rather than provide\\nsuppor t. Oliver described his parents as generally unaware of the extent of his negative experiences at school. He also shared details\\nabout  family dynamics, including discipline practices at home, such as consequences for breaking rules, and his strategies for avoiding\\ndetection when breaking hous ehold rules. Oliver expressed a preference for staying with his mother, as she is less likely to discipline him.\\nHe also discussed his academ ic experience, noting that he finds his current math class unchallenging and is interested in advancing to a\\nhigher level. Oliver mentioned spendi ng summers in Hungary.\\nObjective Content\\nOliver was engaged and c ommunicative throughout the session, providing detailed responses to questions about his family, school, and\\nsocial experiences.

He reports increased arguments, breakdowns in communication, and trust issues with his partner . These symptoms  \\nhave intensified since the wedding and reflect dif ficulty adjusting to new relational dynamics, impacting his emotional well-being and  \\nrelationship functioning\\nMedications\\nNone disclosed by partner.\\nSubjective Report and Symptom Description\\nThe client's partner attended the session alone to discuss her own experiences and concerns. She reported that the past week has been\\nrough due to a back injury sustained while working out, resulting in ongoing pain and frustration about being unable to exercise. This has\\nled to increased negat ive self-talk and stress about her weight and body image. She described a longstanding history of body image\\nconcerns, rooted in childhood experiences of being compared to a thinner sibling and participating in weight loss clinics at a young age.\\nShe shared ongoi ng struggles with body dysmorphia, fluctuating between feeling confident in her progress and being critical of herself,\\nespecially when unabl e to work out or when facing upcoming weigh-ins. She also discussed anxiety related to shopping for clothes and\\nattending social events where she might receive attention or compliments, linking these feelings to past trauma and a desire to avoid\\nbeing noticed. She acknowledged progress in some areas, such as feeling more comfortable in gym clothes and participating in events\\nlike Halloween in costume, but continues to experience distress around clothing choices and public perception. She also mentioned\\nongoi ng respons ibilities related to her daughter's IEP and IHSS meetings, noting some positive experiences with advocacy and follow-up.\\nObjective Content\\nThe client's partner appear ed engage d and open during the session, participating in a candid discussion about her physical and emotional\\nexperiences. She described her back pain in detail, noting limitations in mobility and the impact on her daily routine. She demonstrated\\ninsight into the connec tion between her physical health, emotional well-being, and self-perception. She was able to articulate the origins of\\nher body  image concerns and recognize patterns of negative self-talk. She also identified avoidance behaviors related to shopping and\\nsocial events, as well as coping strategies she has used, such as seeking support from family and focusing on muscle gain rather than\\nweight loss alone. She was receptive to therapeutic interventions and willing to consider new approaches to managing her anxiety and\\nself-criticism.\\n \\nTeleheal th:\\nTherapist met with the client via telehealth and complied with HIPAA requirements.\\nTherapist was at their office during session.\\nThe client's partner was at home during session.\\nOutcome Measures\\n dummylink\\nProgress Note\\nMental W ealth Ambition - A marriage  \\nfamily and child therapy professional  \\ncorporation\\nClinician :Jeffrey Hagle, Associate Clinical Social W orker\\nSupervisor :Rebecca Gehlke Nolan, LMFT\\nPatient : Isaac Mejia, DOB 1 1/2/1999Date and T ime:11/26/2025 10:00 ᴀᴍ - 1 1:00 ᴀᴍ\\nDuration : 60 minutes\\nService Code :90846\\nLocation : Telehealth - Pt Home\\nParticipants : Partner; client not present\\nPage 1 of 3Interventions Used\\nThe following interventions were used: CBT , Cognitive Reframing, Exploration of Emotions, Mindfulness T raining, Psycho-Education,\\nand Supportive Reflection.\\nTreatment Plan Progress\\nObjectives\\n1.

Over the course of six months, the couple will explore at least four key past experiences or relational patterns from early life or past\\nrelationships that may be impacting current trust and emotional reactions, as reported through session dialogue or homework\\nreflections.\\n \\nProgress: Progressing\\nAssessment / Additional Notes\\nThe client's partner continues  to experience significant distress related to body image, weight, and self-esteem, with roots in early\\nchildhood experiences and reinforced by societal and familial pressures. Her recent back injury has exacerbated these concerns, leading\\nto increased negat ive self-talk and anxiety about weight gain and missed workouts. Despite these challenges, she is resilient and willing to\\nengage in self-reflection and therapeu tic interventions. She is making progress in recognizing and challenging unhelpful thought patterns\\nand is open to experimenting with exposure-based strategies to reduce avoidance behaviors around shopping and social events. The\\ntherapist utilized Cognitive Behav ioral Therapy (CBT), Cognitive Reframing, Exploration of Emotions, Mindfulness Training, Psycho-\\nEducation, and Suppor tive Reflection during the session. The therapist also provided practical suggestions for gradual exposure to\\nshoppi ng and encouraged the client to use self-compassion and mindfulness techniques to manage distress. The client was receptive to\\nthe interventions and sugges tions used in session.\\nPlan\\nThe client's partner will continue to work on reframing negative self-talk and increasing self-compassion, particularly in relation to body\\nimage and weight. She will attempt a gradual exposure exercise by shopping for clothing in person, starting with comfortable gym attire\\nand gradual ly trying on different options, while monitoring her distress levels. She will use mindfulness and self-soothing strategies before\\nand after exposure tasks, and will reflect on her experiences in the next session.
